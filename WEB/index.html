                    <p>Welcome to the first chapter. Scroll down to explore the nexus of freight traffic, idling hotspots, and environmental justice across New York City.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 1: Full Problem Layers</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Establishes the city-wide extent of air quality risk and exposure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is an initial composite view showing all problem layers overlaid: major <strong>Freight Routes</strong> , <strong>Junction Hotspots</strong>, high <strong>Asthma Index Rates</strong>, and <strong>Vulnerable Facilities</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>Focus: South Bronx Density</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Reveals acute exposure where <strong>Vulnerable Facilities</strong> (schools, hospitals) are directly adjacent to high-traffic and high-density idling areas.</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Zooms in on the South Bronx to highlight the clear, high density of idling and the acute spatial relationship between traffic and sensitive sites.</p>

                    <h2>Health Burden: Vulnerable Communities</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The overlap between pollution hotspots and <strong>Vulnerable Facilities</strong> (schools, healthcare centers) reveals environmental injustice, as those most sensitive to air impacts are in the areas of highest exposure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Shifts focus to the <strong>Vulnerable Facilities</strong> surrounded by pollution, making a direct argument about spatial injustice.</p>

                    <h2>Freight Focus: Industrial Corridors</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Industrial corridors (<strong>Freight Routes</strong>) create disproportionate exposure in nearby residential areas, contributing to the asthma burden.</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Isolates the <strong>Freight Routes</strong> that run through residential areas, emphasizing the industrial infrastructure that impacts community air quality.</p>

                <div class="narrative">
                    <h2>Policy: Targeting Green Spaces</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Freight and idling zones often overlap with areas lacking sufficient green infrastructure (<strong>Park Lots</strong>), leading to poor air quality filtration in the most affected neighborhoods.</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Isolates <strong>Park Lots</strong> to show the dual burden: high pollution sources combined with a lack of natural cooling and filtration amenities.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion: Data-Driven Regulation</h2>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The data confirms the need for a more targeted approach to enforce idling laws and protect vulnerable populations in these specific hotspots.</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Serves as a call to action, concluding that the visual evidence necessitates data-driven regulatory change.</p>
